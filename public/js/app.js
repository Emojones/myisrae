 * TODO: I would like to see a lot more comments in your front-end JS
 * 
 * Your angular code is pretty clean, but a few quick notes about what each block of code does
 * can help you quickly dive in and get to a specific place.
 * 
 * The you a year from now who picks this project back up to do some tweaks or fix bugs will thank you.
 * 
 * (I'm loving the comments throughout your CSS, for example)
