    <p>ISRAE is dedicated to the scientific research of religious and anomalous experiences while providing community education on religion and anomalous phenomena through public lectures and presentations, as well as work experience through internships and volunteerism.</p>
    <h3>What is ISRAE?</h3>
    <p>ISRAE is an institute founded by Dr. Brain Laythe dedicated to the study of religious and anomalous experience. We are a 501(c) Non-Profit located in Jeffersonville, IN that focuses on a subject that many researches consider taboo. Parapsychology. You may be wondering what that means. Are we ghost hunters? No. In fact, we strive to separate ourselves from anyone and anything that could interfere with our research by adding such a bias to it.</p>

    <h3>What Do We Research?</h3>
    <p>ISRAE researches religion and all things measurable and anomalous. This includes topics such as EVP (electronic voice phenomenon), the psychological effects of belief, and physical changes in the environment. Our findings tend to have one thing in common. They shouldn't be happening in labratory conditions. But they are. We don't know, or claim to know, why.</p>

    <h3>What Separates Our Research From Others?</h3>
    <p>You may have already seen that we are the ONLY research institute in the US actively publishing in academic research journals about haunt phenomenon. That is because this kind of research is very difficult to do thouroughly, and requires days of data collection and review. We also hold ourselves to the highest of standards in our research. We operate by a very simple phrase: When in doubt, rule it out. While haunt phenomenon and parapsychology seem to be a taboo subject, our research is vetted in the same way that research on pharmcutical drugs, psychological discoveries, and other such mainstream research is performed and analyzed. We use the scientific method, account for chance, and submit our journal articles before a peer-review panel of researchers across the country. No other "paranormal group" in the US is taking these steps. Our researchers are trained in emperical methods of research, and all either have or are pursuing their Bachelor's degrees and above in various fields of study. We firmly believe that having a trained team of academics is cruitial to our institution. While we will not discriminate against those without a college education, we WILL require anybody who would like to join our research team to take a class in emperical research methods created by Dr. Laythe and the members of our team.</p>

    <h3>Are You Believers or Skeptics?</h3>
    <p>We welcome both to the table, so long as both Believers and Skeptics are willing to put down their belief in favor of collecting valid evidence and educating themselves with reliable and demonstrated information. ISRAE realizes that many people have strong beliefs about paranormal phenomena. While we respect those beliefs, our job is to critically and honestly collect data and evidence that supports or rejects claims of paranormal phenomena.</p>
