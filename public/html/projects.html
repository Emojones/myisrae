                <h2>RIGS 2</h2>
                <p>Portable Data-Logging Temperature and Electro-Magnetic Field Meters. Using Audrino components, we now utilize micro data loggers that sample three axis EMF readings and ambient temperature at two samples per second. With the use of universal
                    time-stamps, this allows us to coordinate all video and audio to specific readings of either temperature or EMF and perform mathematical tests to examine for physical environmental anomalies.</p>

                <h2>AUDIO COMPARISON ANALYSIS SOFTWARE (ACAS)</h2>
                <p>We are in process of beta testing software that analyzes the audio envelopes of wav. files, and then provides times where noise is indicated. Our completed app will also compare multiple audio recorders based on their time stamp, and provide
                    us (and others) a list where only one recorder shows “noise”. We hope to use this software to methodically examine electronic voice phenomena. Our working theory is that any noise present on only one of five recorders that is a good
                    place to examine for potential EVP. Once beta testing is completed, we will be providing access to this application for other scientists, organizations, and groups.</p>

                <h2>EXISTING VIDEO MOTION ANALYSIS (EVMA)</h2>
                <p>One of the problems with motion detection for video recording systems is that a full record of video is never obtained. We’re working on fixing that. Our members and programmers are just now starting on this programming application. Our
                    hope is to create a program that will take existing AVI. video and scan it for not just motion, but distance traveled across the screen, and size. With this application, we hope to methodically examine video under constant standards.
                    As the program is developed and tested we will also offer this technology to other scientists, organizations, and groups.</p>
